      <description>On March 9, 2018, (hey, better late than never :), Security Jam, a security meeting/conference, was held, where speakers present their Research in a relaxed environment.
Last year I was lucky enough to be able to participate as a Speaker giving a talk called:
Love is in the air: Reverse Engineering a shitty drone.
In addition to the Security Jam, I presented this talk at CharruaCon and 8.8 Chile, two highly recommended conferences for those who have not attended!</description>
